✨ AnimateFlow
AnimateFlow is a dynamic and visually rich front-end web application developed primarily as a personal side project. Its core purpose is to deepen front-end development skills, with a significant focus on intricate animations and an exceptionally smooth user experience. The application heavily leverages the powerful GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library, including its ScrollSmoother and ScrollTrigger plugins, to create fluid, scroll-driven, and interactive animations.
This project serves as a practical sandbox for mastering advanced animation techniques, performance optimization for animated content, and integrating sophisticated visual effects within a modern React environment.
Users can expect:
🎨 Captivating Visuals: Experience a variety of engaging and complex animations across different sections.
🚀 Silky-Smooth Scrolling: Enjoy a highly optimized and fluid scrolling sensation powered by ScrollSmoother.
⚡ Interactive Elements: Interact with UI components that respond dynamically through carefully crafted animations.
📈 Performance-Driven Design: Witness high-performance animations, even with numerous effects, showcasing best practices.
